            <ul>
                <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
                <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
                <li>A string within a variable is defined by quotes(Contains words and numbers).</li>
                <li>A variable is only needed once in order to classify the value.</li>
                <li>"=" assigns a value.</li>
                <li>EX: Function 'name of function'(){}</li>
                <li>Boolean usually denotes true or false.</li>
                <li>A Modulus is a remainder after dividing.</li>
                <li>The && requires bothe expressions to be true in order to return true.</li>
                <li>The || only requires one of the expressions to be true in order to return true.</li>
                <li>EX: 'if'('Conditional') {'Action'}</li>
                <li>EX: 'else if' can be used for many Conditionals until the last Conditional which uses only 'else'</li>
                <li>Conditionals include == ,>= , > ,=== , && , || , ETC.</li>
                <li>'Console.log' inputs into the console within the web page.</li>
                <li>An index uses [] inside conditionals at the end in order to select which array to use.</li>
                <li>An array is a collection ov values ,and should be contained within square brackets while seperated by commas.</li>
                <li>Array EX: var snacks = "Apple","Pear","Peach","Strawberry"</li>
                <li>Arrays start at [0] index.</li>
                <li>You can change the values of indexs you select.</li>
                <li>EX: snacks[2] = "Chips" which replaces "Peach" from the previous array</li>
                <li>'Length' represents the total amount of items in the array.</li>
                <li>A 'for' loop is used to exacute code more than once using the index system.</li>
                <li>A 'function' can be assigned to a 'var' and can be used more than once.</li>
                <li>Function can have perameters that can add future data into the function.</li>
                <li>When first creating a function it doesnt work until you declare it later and input the variables/perameters</li>
                <li>Global scope is when a variable or 'var' isn't nested inside a function or any other object within the javascript.
                </li>
                <li>Local scope has a 'var' inside a function or object and is only used within that function or object</li>
                <li>In a string if you wish to add another part you must use a concatonation like '+'</li>
                <li>EX of concatonation in a string: var sayHello = "Hello World" + "!"</li>
                <li>Methods are used to effect a variable EX. variableName.method()</li>
                <li>'Sort' method takes an array and sorts the information within the array</li>
                <li>'Push' method adds elements to end of an array. Takes in at least one parameter</li>
                <li>'Splice' method returns selected elements as a new array.</li>
                <li>EX:var logicalOperators = ["and", "or", "not"];</li>
                <li>var logicalOperatorsSliced = logicalOperators.slice(0,2);</li>
                <li>Returns ["and", "or"] It doesnt include the index number you end with.</li>
                <li>'Replace' method takes what is in the () like ("local" , "global") and replaces the first element and replaces it
                    with the second one.</li>
                <li>'Splice' method removes pieces of the array by choosing the index number associated with the piece you want to
                    remove(can be one or mutiple).</li>
                <li>'Concat' merges two arrays together and should be written as such : var heathySnacks = fruits.concat(veggies)</li>
                <li>Objects are defined with curly brackets and within the curly brackets is where the properties of the object will be
                    assigned</li>
